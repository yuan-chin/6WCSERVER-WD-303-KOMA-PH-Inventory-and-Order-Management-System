# KOMA PH ORDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 

This program is programmed by using MEVN.
The rationale of creating this system is that it will assist KOMA PH in shifting to less manual work and a more coordinated, effective, and factual system. The implementation of such a system will allow the business to streamline operations, minimize human mistakes, increase customer satisfaction, and provide a stable basis on which the expansion will take place in the future. Another objective of the project is to show how web technologies can be used in addressing real-life management issues of business.
